# genetic1

This is code for testing some stuff with Genetic Algorithms (GA).

Population.py is the important class here. It is the one that creates a
population of individuals, controls their mating, mutation, sorts them by fitness
function (FF), and evolves them.

It is designed to be used with any class for the individual, as long as the individual
has these functions:

- `fitnessFunction()`
- `isSameState()`
- `mate()`
- `mutate()`
- `solFound()`
- `plotState()`
- and a `.state` member variable

I keep my individuals in an IndividualClasses/ directory that's in a different folder
at the same level as this one (so other projects can use the same Individuals),
which is why I add `sys.path.append('../IndividualClasses')` to the beginning of ga1.py,
but you could just put the individual class in this dir as well.

To create a population, this is how I typically do it:

```
pop1 = Population(Brachistochrone, Npop, N=20, height=1.3, sameness_thresh=15*10**-2, mutate_strength_height_frac=0.21, same_thresh_decay_steps=N_gen)
```

- `Brachistochrone` is the name of the individual class (imported)
- `Npop` is population size
- `Npts`, mutate_strength_height, and height are parameters specific to the `Brachistochrone` class. Population
will check for certain parameters passed to it, but also pass all `**kwargs` parameters
to the individual class, so parameters that are specific to the class should be passed
to `Population`'s init, like this.

-`sameness_thresh` and `same_thresh_decay_steps` are actually also specific to `Brachistochrone`,
but should probably be incorporated into any problem that's continuous.

Part of what I found, working with this, was that for problems that are continuous like this one,
you need to make sure the solutions can't get too similar to each other while it's searching, or
they will converge to a state that's not even a local minimum, just a little hard to find the way
out of. So that's what `sameness_thresh` is, it's the threshold below which two states are
considered the same. However, you also want to decrease this as the search gets
finer, so that's what `same_thresh_decay_steps` is for. It's the number of steps it will
take to geometrically decrease to `10**-5`.

To run an evolution of the population:
```
ending_state = pop1.plotEvolve(N_gen=N_gen, plot_whole_pop=True, make_gif=True, show_plot=False)
```

- `N_gen` is the number of generations to run for
- `plot_whole_pop` is a parameter for plotting the whole population in the state plot
- `make_gif` is whether you'd like to make a gif of the progression, it limits it to 50 or 100
frames
- `show_plot` is whether it shows you the plot updating as you run

the individual class is expected to have a `plotState()` function that you pass it an axis
to, and it plots the state of that individ.


This definitely isn't as clear as it could be, so please message me for any questions, comments,
